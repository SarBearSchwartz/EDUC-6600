\large Unit 3 Exam \normalsize (Summer 2018) \hfill Score:________ /100

**Directions:** This exam covers unit 3 material. You may use your notes and homework. You have 30 minutes to complete it. Good luck!

## `Multiple Choice [5 points each]` -- Circle the one-correct answer.

1. A researcher finds that the **correlation** between obesity and satisfaction with life in general is -.74, and that this correlation is statistically significant using the .05 criterion. The researcher can conclude that:
    a. Being obese (i.e., overweight) makes people unhappy with life in general.
    b. Being unhappy with life in general causes people to become overweight.
    c. Neither of the above. <!-- Correct -->
    d. Both a. and b.
    
\vspace{10pt}

2. The **matched t** will _equal_ the **independent-samples t** calculated on the same data, when:
    a. The correlation between the two sets of scores is zero. <!-- Correct -->
    b. The correlation between the two sets of scores is 1.0.
    c. The variability of the difference scores is zero.
    d. The sample variances of the two sets of scores are equal.

\vspace{10pt}

3. The **coefficient of determination** ($r^2$) can be interpreted as:
    a. The proportion of variance in the outcome explained by the predictor. <!-- Correct -->
    b. The proportion of variance in the predictor accounted for by the outcome.
    c. The degree of differences in means of the groups.
    d. None of the above.

\vspace{10pt}

4. If the raw scores of X and Y are _standardized_ (transformed into z-scores), which of the following is _TRUE_?
    a. The correlation turns to zero.
    b. The correlation and regression estimate are equal. <!-- Correct -->
    c. The correlation can never be negative.
    d. The correlation turns to 1.0.


## `Statistical Application [80 points]`

**Situation:** A famous singer wants to know if her music changes attitudes regarding a political position (i.e., by listening to her music, an attitude change occurs). She hires you to set up an experiment. You recruit 10 individuals, give them a baseline attitude test, have the participants listen to the music, and then administer a posttest regarding their attitudes. You then analyze the collected data, using the useful information you learned from your 6600 class.

Two sets of output are found below, one for regression and one for matched t-test. Report and interpret the output that corresponds to the correct analysis of the situation at hand. The following table shows descriptive statistics of the sample.

6. **Circle the appropriate output** (on the following page) that answers the research question. `[25 points]`

```{r}
set.seed(843)
library(tidyverse)
df <- data_frame(
  baseline = runif(9, max = 5) + 5,
  posttest = baseline + runif(9, max = 5)
)
```

```{r, results = 'asis', comment = ""}
df %>%
  mutate(diff = posttest - baseline) %>%
  tidyr::gather("time", "value", 1:3) %>%
  mutate(time = factor(time, levels = c("baseline", "posttest", "diff"),
                       labels = c("Baseline", "Posttest", "Difference Score"))) %>%
  mutate(Measure = time) %>%
  dplyr::group_by(Measure) %>%
  furniture::table1(value,
                    var_names = c("Mean (SD)"),
                    type = "condense",
                    output = "latex2",
                    caption = "Descriptive statistics of the sample.")
```

\newpage

```{r}
df %>%
  lm(posttest ~ baseline,
     data = .) %>%
  summary
cat("\n------")
```

```{r}
df %>%
  tidyr::gather("time", "value", 1:2) %>%
  mutate(time = factor(time, levels = c("posttest", "baseline"),
                       labels = c("Posttest", "Baseline"))) %>%
  t.test(value ~ time,
         data = .,
         paired = TRUE)
```

7. Calculate the appropriate **effect size** for the results. `[15 points]`

8. **Report** the correct results in **APA format** and **interpret** it, including the significance, effect size, and confidence intervals. `[20 points for proper reporting; 20 for correct interpretation]`
