# Exploring Quantitative Data

### Building on what we've already discussed:

.large[.large[
1. Always plot your data: .dcoral[make a graph].
2. Look for the overall pattern (.nicegreen[shape, center, and spread]) and for striking departures such as .nicegreen[outliers].
3. Calculate a numerical summary to briefly .bluer[describe center and spread].
4. Sometimes the overall pattern of a large number of observations is so regular that we can describe it by a smooth curve.

# Let's Start with Density Curves

.huge[
A .dcoral[density curve] is a curve that:
]

.large[.large[
- is always on or above the horizontal axis
- has an area of exactly 1 underneath it

It describes the overall pattern of a distribution and highlights proportions of observations as the area.

.large[
- The process of .nicegreen[statistical inference] involves using information .dcoral[from a sample] to draw conclusions about a wider population.

- Different random samples yield different statistics. We need to be able to describe the .dcoral[sampling distribution] of possible statistic values in order to perform .nicegreen[statistical inference].


- We can think of a statistic as a .nicegreen[random variable] because it takes numerical values that describe the outcomes of the .dcoral[random sampling process].

If we took every one of the possible samples of a certain size, calculated the sample mean for each, and graphed all of those values, we'd have a .dcoral[sampling distribution].
