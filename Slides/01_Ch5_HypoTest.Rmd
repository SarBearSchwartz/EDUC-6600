# Two Types of Research Questions


.pull-left[
.center[
### Do .dcoral[groups] <br>*significantly* .dcoral[differ] <br> on 1 or more characteristics?
]

Comparing group means, counts, or proportions

.dcoral[
- $t$-tests
- ANOVA
- $\chi^2$ tests]
]


.pull-right[
.center[
### Is there a <br> *significant* .nicegreen[relationship] <br> among a set of .nicegreen[variables]?
]


Testing the association or dependence

.nicegreen[
- Correlation
- Regression]
]

# Inferential Statistics

.pull-left[
## Descriptive statistics are limited

- Rely only on **raw** data distribution
- Generally describe **one** variable only
- Do not address **accuracy** of estimators or hypothesis testing
- How **precise** is sample mean or does it differ from a given value?
- Are there between or within **group differences** or **associations**?
]

.pull-right[
### Goals of inferential statistics

- .dcoral[Hypothesis testing]
  - $p$-values
- .dcoral[Parameter estimation]
  - confidence intervals


### Repeated sampling
- Estimators will vary from sample to sample
- Sampling or random error is variability due to chance

# Causality and Statistics


## .dcoral[Causality] depends <br> on .nicegreen[**evidence**] <br> from outside statistics:


- Phenomenological (educational, behavioral, biological) credibility
- Strength of association – ruling out occurrence by chance alone
- Consistency with past research findings
- Temporality
- Dose-response relationship
- Specificity
- Prevention

.large[.dcoral[**Causality** is often a **judgmental** evaluation <br> of **combined** results from **several studies**]]

# z-Scores and Statistical Inference


Probabilities of $z$-scores used to determine how **unlikely** or **unusual** a single case is relative to other cases in a sample 

## .center[**Small** probabilities <br> .dcoral[*(p-values)*] <br> reflect **unlikely** or **unusual scores**]

Not frequently interested in whether **individual scores** are unusual relative to others, but whether scores from **groups of cases** are unusual.

.nicegreen[**Sample mean**], $\bar{x}$ or $M$, summarizes .nicegreen[**central tendency**] of a group or sample of subjects

# Steps of a Hypothesis test 

.pull-left[
1. State the .nicegreen[Hypotheses] 
  - Null & Alternative
2. Select the .nicegreen[Statistical Test] & .nicegreen[Significance Level] 
  - $\alpha$ level
  - One vs. Two tails
3. Select random sample and collect data
4. Find the .nicegreen[Region of Rejection]
  - Based on $\alpha$ & # of tails
4. Calculate the .nicegreen[Test Statistic]
  - Examples include: $z, t, F, \chi^2$
5. Write the .nicegreen[Conclusion]
  - Statistical decision must by in context!

# Stating Hypotheses

Hypotheses are always specified in terms of .dcoral[**population**]
- Use $\mu$ for the population mean, not $\bar{x}$ which is for a sample

.pull-left[ 
**If you are comparing TWO population MEANS:**

.large[

.dcoral[**Null** Hypothesis]

$$H_0: \mu_1 = \mu_2$$

.center[
.nicegreen[**Research** or Alternative Hypothesis] <br> options...
]

$$H_1: \mu_1 \ne \mu_2$$
$$H_1: \mu_1 \lt \mu_2$$
$$H_1: \mu_1 \gt \mu_2$$

# Innocent Until Proven Guilty

**IF** there is Not enough statistical evidence to reject…

Judgment suspended until further evidence evaluated:

- “Inconclusive”
- Larger sample?
- Insufficient data?

# Rejecting the Null Hypothesis

.pull-left[

.large[Assumption:] 

The .dcoral[NULL] hypothesis is .dcoral[TRUE] in the .dcoral[POPULATION]

- Always base calculations on the NULL value(s)

.nicegreen[.large[IF:] 

The p-value is very **SMALL**]

- How small?  If $p-value \lt \alpha$

.nicegreen[.large[THEN:] 

We have evidence AGAINST the NULL hypothesis]

- It is **UNLIKELY** we would have observed a sample that extreme **JUST DUE TO RANDOM CHANCE**...

.pull-right[
.large[Criteria:] 

May judge by either...
- the p-value $\lt \alpha$   
-OR-   
- test statistic $\lt$ Critical Value

We either **REJECT** or **FAIL TO REJECT** the .nicegreen[Null] hypothesis
